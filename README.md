# Memory Card Game

## Overview
This is a responsive Memory Card Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The game uses emoji faces for cards, so no external images or assets are required.
Players flip cards to find matching pairs. Different difficulty levels change the grid size.

This project was created as part of my internship to practice JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.
